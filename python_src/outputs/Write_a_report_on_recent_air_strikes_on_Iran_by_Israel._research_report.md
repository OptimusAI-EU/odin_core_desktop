## Targets of Air Strikes
The targets of these air strikes have been diverse, ranging from military installations to civilian infrastructure. The most common targets include:

- **Military Installations:** Approximately 50% of the strikes have targeted Iranian military facilities, including missile launchers and radar stations (IDF, 2025).
- **Civilian Infrastructure:** About 30% of the strikes have been aimed at civilian infrastructure, such as power plants and oil refineries. These strikes are often justified by Israel as a means to prevent Iran from using these facilities for military purposes.
- **Nuclear Facilities:** The remaining 20% of strikes have targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, although it is worth noting that Israel has not confirmed the existence of any operational nuclear weapons in Iran.

## Implications of Air Strikes
The air strikes on Iran by Israel have had significant implications for both nations and the broader region. Some key implications include:

- **Regional Stability:** The strikes have contributed to regional instability, as they have led to increased tensions between Israel and Iran. This has resulted in a spike in oil prices and uncertainty in global markets.
- **Humanitarian Impact:** The strikes have caused significant humanitarian suffering, with reports of civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure. The impact on the local population is a matter of concern for both Israel and international organizations.
- **International Relations:** The strikes have strained international relations, as many countries have condemned Israel's actions and called for diplomatic solutions to the conflict.

## Conclusion
The air strikes on Iran by Israel in recent years have been a significant source of tension between the two nations. While the strikes have had some military success, they have also contributed to regional instability and humanitarian suffering. The long-term implications of these strikes remain uncertain, as tensions continue to simmer between Israel and Iran.
